"""
# Task: Write a Python program which accepts the radius of a circle from the user and compute the area.

from math import pi
r=float(input("Input the radius of the circle:"))
print("The area of the circle with the given radius is:",pi*r**2)

# The import function will retrieve the necessary data needed to do the compute the area of the circle.
# Then, the print function will print the given statement.
