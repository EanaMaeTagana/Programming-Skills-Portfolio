print("Twinkle, twinkle, little star,\n\tHow I wonder what you are!\n\t\tUp above the world so high,\n\t\tLike a diamond in the sky.\nTwinkle, twinkle, little star,\n\tHow I wonder what you are!")

# Use the print function to allow the given statement to be printed.
# The \n (newline) function will allow the statement to be printed on a new line. The \t (tab) function will print the statement with a certain amount of indentation.
